# PushBulletBot
A bot that uses PushBullet's API to notify me of stuff. This is very sloppy python code, feel free to contribute and clean it up.


Feel free to use this code, just give me credit if you decide to upload a modified version.

#Variables
In order for the script to work properly, the following variables need to be filled out:

`weatherCode`,  go to https://weather.codes and search for your location.

`name` needs to be filled out with, well, your name.

`api_key`, fill this variable in with your PushBullet API key, this can be found under "Your account"

#Installation
Make sure you have PushBullet installed on your android device (This is coming soon to iOS!)

Make sure you have pip installed, if not, do it [Here.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/software/python.md)

If you have pip installed already, cd to your desktop (or wherever you saved `requirements.txt`) (Most RaspPi's desktop are located like the following image)

After that is completed, type `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
